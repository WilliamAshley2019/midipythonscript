# midipythonscript
This is a script I have started for reading midi sysex, and other midi information - only working as intended for midi sysex currently. The long term project goals are to get it to read midi cc, midi sysex and mmc, and allow those things to be mapped to and from midi cc, midi sysex and mmc and be detected as a midi device readable by fl studio, etc
